Plakup here, bringing you the freshest acorns of updates from the Plakar hackroom! We’ve had a whirlwind of activity, new faces joining the team, and some clever improvements from Gilles, Julien, and the whole gang. So grab a coffee (or a handful of sunflower seeds, if you’re like me), and let’s jump into the latest!\n1. Welcome Julien Castets! # First things first, let’s give a warm Plakar welcome to Julien \u0026ldquo;niluje\u0026rdquo; Castets, who joined us on November 11! 🎉 Julien has already jumped in with creative ideas and code contributions (not to mention his GitHub Action adventures). We’re thrilled to have him onboard and excited to see the magic he’ll bring to Plakar’s UI and more!\n2. File Testing and the Search for a Pathological Corpus 🗂️ # The team has been diving into file testing strategies, with discussions around a “corpus” to push Plakar’s boundaries. The idea? A hybrid set of test files that cover all sorts of types: from small files to hefty images, randomized data, and even edge cases like empty files, /dev/zero, and /dev/random files, and cyclic symlinks. By testing these edge cases, the team ensures that Plakar handles any file you throw its way! 🌞\n3. Fixing Permissions with Precision: chmod Restoration Updates 🔧 # One of Gilles’s top priorities this week was addressing a restore permissions issue. After a bit of restructuring, the restore now handles permissions more gracefully by making directory creation (with a secure 0700 mode) a standalone step. Once child files are processed, it finalizes permissions with SetPermissions, ensuring everything restores exactly as it should—hats off, Gilles!\n4. UI Revamp and Automation with GitHub Actions # Julien didn’t waste any time getting to work on enhancing Plakar’s UI workflow. He’s been wrestling with GitHub Actions, setting up a process to automate builds, updates, and even PR creation between plakar-ui and the main Plakar repository. After some experimentation (and a few “aha!” moments), Julien proposed a more streamlined approach: a manual workflow in Plakar that lets us specify branches for seamless UI updates with a single click. The ambition and energy Julien’s brought to Plakar’s UI are nothing short of inspiring! 🚀\nExperimental UI Structure # Julien also suggested consolidating some of the UI folders, like ui/v2, to simplify the setup. Although this change was closed to keep options open for future experiments, it shows the team’s forward-thinking approach as they plan for long-term UI flexibility.\n5. Smarter Snapshot Navigation # Julien also made a small but impactful fix on the UI front, addressing a navigational quirk where users were directed back to the root directory when backtracking in snapshots. Now, when users enter a snapshot, they’ll land directly in the directory they last viewed, making Plakar feel smoother and more intuitive. With Julien’s contributions, the UI is already shaping up beautifully.\n6. Path Normalization for Backup \u0026amp; Restore 🛠️ # To tackle path inconsistencies across case-sensitive and insensitive filesystems, Gilles added a nifty enhancement to store the current working directory (CWD) as normalized context. By using the stored CWD, Plakar backups and restores handle paths consistently and robustly, sidestepping potential mishaps with os.Getwd().\n7. A Lighter, More Flexible Exporter Interface ✨ # Gilles also introduced a clean-up to the exporter interface by dropping FileInfo from certain method calls and adding SetPermissions. This refinement simplifies the code structure, allowing for more modular permission handling and overall neater restoration operations.\n8. Introducing the Event Bus: Real-Time CLI Notifications 🚨 # Gilles has implemented an internal event bus that allows real-time notifications in the CLI during backup processing. This event bus is a game-changer for CLI users, providing live feedback on what’s happening behind the scenes—from file processing to progress updates. This improvement adds a whole new level of interactivity and responsiveness to the backup experience.\nClosing Thoughts: Teamwork Makes the Magic # This week brought not just improvements to code but lively banter, fresh ideas, and an undeniable sense of camaraderie among the team. Julien’s already making a mark, Gilles is chipping away at the codebase with precision and purpose, and the UI is becoming more streamlined and user-friendly than ever. Every line of code, every suggestion, and every laugh shared helps Plakar evolve into something stronger.\nUntil next time, Plakar enthusiasts! Keep those snapshots sharp, code clean, and permissions perfect! 🐿️\n— Plakup, your friendly Plakar chipmunk\n","date":"13 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/community-news/2024-11_01/","section":"Plakar community updates","summary":"","title":"Plakar Hackroom Highlights: New Faces, Fresh Fixes, and UI Upgrades 🐿️","type":"community-news"},{"content":"Hello Plakar pals and curious coders! Plakup here, ready to share all the exciting updates from the past week. Between a new team member, feature-packed improvements, and visionary ideas for Plakar’s future, there’s plenty to talk about. So grab a coffee (or your favorite acorn snack), and let’s dive in!\n1. Team Updates: Welcome Omar ! # We’re thrilled to announce that Omar Polo (@op) joined the team last week! 🎉 With his skills and fresh ideas, we’re excited to see the ways he’ll help Plakar continue to evolve.\n2. Reviving Features and Streamlining Code 🛠️ # FUSE is Back! # You read that right—Plakar now supports mounting your repository as a filesystem with the plakar mount command! This feature makes accessing your snapshots as intuitive as browsing your desktop files. FUSE integration is back and better than ever.\nSnapshot Signing # Your data has never been safer! Plakar now supports snapshot signing, which ensures the integrity and authenticity of your backups. This feature is ready to go, and the CLI will soon be extended to make snapshot signing a breeze.\nPer-Directory Summaries and Error Tracking # Debugging backups just got easier. Plakar now tracks per-directory summaries and errors, offering clear insights into what’s happening in your snapshots.\nS3 Importer Revamp # The S3 importer has been updated to match the new importer interface, following the recent repository refactor. This update ensures smoother functionality and a more flexible architecture moving forward.\nRepository and State Refactor # Gilles undertook a significant effort to simplify the core repository and snapshot state layers. By consolidating duplicate functions and refining the packfile interfaces, the codebase is now more maintainable, efficient, and ready for future improvements. This behind-the-scenes work ensures Plakar is primed for upcoming features and expansions.\n3. UI Enhancements: Downloads and More! 📥 # The Plakar UI is evolving fast! You can now download files directly from the UI with a single click. And that’s just the start—support for downloading multiple files and directories is on the horizon. Julien’s efforts have transformed the UI into an even more user-friendly tool, with much more to come.\n4. PoC Spotlight: gRPC-Based Plugin System 🔌 # Plakar supports three importers—fs, ftp, and s3—but we’re looking ahead to support even more. Julien has been prototyping a gRPC-based plugin system. Here’s the vision:\nThe Plugin Architecture # Standalone Plugins: Importers now run as separate binaries communicating with Plakar via gRPC. Cross-Language Support: SDKs like Go (and potentially Python, Java, and more) enable developers to create custom importers in their preferred language. This approach paves the way for external plugins, allowing users to add new functionality to Plakar easily. It’s a step toward making Plakar as flexible and extensible as possible, while maintaining top-notch performance.\n5. Closing Thoughts: A Transformative Week 🌟 # From welcoming Omar to reviving FUSE, revamping the repository, and experimenting with a gRPC-based plugin system, this has been an incredible week for Plakar. The team is hard at work refining the core, making the UI more powerful, and exploring new ideas for the future.\nUntil next time, keep your snapshots secure, your plugins polished, and your acorns plentiful! 🐿️\n— Plakup, your friendly Plakar chipmunk\n","date":"13 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/community-news/2024-11_02/","section":"Plakar community updates","summary":"","title":"Plakar Hackroom Highlights: New Features, Fresh Faces, and Big Ideas 🐿️","type":"community-news"},{"content":"","date":"13 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/plakup/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Plakup","type":"authors"},{"content":"","date":"13 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"13 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/technology/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Technology","type":"categories"},{"content":"Hello, Plakar enthusiasts and curious readers alike! Plakup here—Plakar\u0026rsquo;s very own chatty chipmunk correspondent. 🐿️ It\u0026rsquo;s been an exciting and productive few days at Plakar Korp, with lots of brainstorming, coding, and passionate exchanges between the community members. We thought we\u0026rsquo;d take a moment to highlight all the cool stuff that\u0026rsquo;s been happening, so grab a cup of coffee (or a handful of acorns, if you\u0026rsquo;re like me), and let’s dive in!\n1. Struct Surgery: A New Type Era # First up, the spotlight is on Gilles (our resident code whisperer) for some major restructuring work. Previously, we were using a FileInfo struct with lots of fields like Lname, Lsize, Lmode, and more. But hey, who needs all those clunky fields when you can redefine the data model, right? Gilles waved his magic wand (okay, it was probably just a keyboard) and introduced a new ObjectType construct with categories like ObjectTypeFile, ObjectTypeDir, and ObjectTypeSymlink.\nThis change not only makes things more streamlined and elegant but also preps the codebase for more sophisticated functionalities. A round of applause, everyone! 🎉\n2. RIP Agent Layer \u0026amp; Config Layer: Gone but Not Forgotten # Next, we had a bittersweet moment—Gilles decided to pull the plug on the agent and config layers. Don’t worry, they were just prototypes. Think of it like a caterpillar shedding its skin, getting ready to emerge as a beautiful butterfly (or maybe a more sophisticated piece of software). 🦋 These layers will be reimplemented with a more robust approach down the line, so stay tuned!\n3. Enviable Environment Variables # Security and flexibility are paramount in Plakar’s world. With that in mind, Gilles added support for two new environment variables: PLAKAR_PASSPHRASE and PLAKAR_REPOSITORY. Now you can export your passphrase and repository settings directly from the terminal, making the backup workflow smoother and more adaptable. No more fumbling around with long command lines! ✨\nHere’s a quick recap:\n$ export PLAKAR_PASSPHRASE=totototo $ plakar create $ plakar push $ plakar ls 2024-10-10T23:09:34Z 6d7a9690 4.0 GB 9s /Users/gilles/Wip/github.com/PlakarLabs $ And voilà! Snapshots are safely created and listed. 🗃️\n4. Importer Enhancements: Now with Extended Attributes # Who knew importing could be so exciting? Gilles revamped the importer to capture additional file information, including extended attributes. Now, this might not sound like the most thrilling update at first, but it’s a game-changer when it comes to file fidelity and metadata preservation.\n5. UI Overhaul Discussions: Making Plakar User-Friendly # When it comes to usability, it’s not just about how things work but also how they look and feel. That’s where Julien Castets stepped in, throwing some seriously great UI ideas into the mix. We’ve been brainstorming different views for snapshots:\nSnapshots View: Lists snapshots in chronological order and shows file lists by default. File Kind/Mime-type View: Displays files based on their type (e.g., images, documents). Julien pointed out that multiple entries of the same file across snapshots should consolidate into a single entry for easier viewing. Great point, Julien! 👍\nGlobal Search: To quickly locate files across all snapshots with just one search bar. Simplicity at its finest. And Julien even touched on a potential \u0026ldquo;diff mode\u0026rdquo; feature for comparing snapshots. A little fine-tuning is needed here, but the team’s onto something big.\n6. Diffs \u0026amp; Comparisons: The Path Forward # Snapshot comparisons are a cornerstone of Plakar’s backup strategy. Gilles explained the vision for a more intuitive diff interface, where changes between snapshots (be it files or directories) can be visualized side-by-side. Here’s what he has in mind:\nTwo-Column View: Think of it as a split screen where changes are highlighted—what’s new, what’s missing, and what’s been modified. Unified Diff View: Displaying the differences between specific files in a unified way, just like your favorite code diff tool. There’s still work to be done, but these ideas lay a solid foundation for future development.\n7. Repository Refactor: The Final Frontier Before v1 # Ah, the grand refactor! For those following along, Gilles has been laying out a detailed plan to refactor the repository format before Plakar hits v1. This refactor aims to remove locking issues, reduce memory consumption, and introduce a more efficient way to manage packfiles and indexes.\nSome highlights:\nLock-free Repository: Moving to an append-only state system, so no locking is required for parallel operations like pushes and cleanups. Efficient Indexes: Using a hybrid RAM-disk cache for large indexes, reducing the strain on both CPU and memory. Smart Maintenance: Introducing a way to manage and clean packfiles without impacting active snapshots or parallel operations. While Gilles has been spearheading this refactor, community members like Antoine and Nanark have been actively participating in these discussions, adding their insights and ensuring the upcoming changes will benefit everyone.\nHere’s a snippet from one of Gilles’ updates:\n\u0026ldquo;The refactor is going to require some work, but it’s far less invasive than I first assumed. The first thing I need to change is the handling of indexes. Right now, the indexes contain the entire mapping. What needs to be changed is that indexes generated by a snapshot should only ever carry the delta between that snapshot and the previous index.\u0026rdquo;\nClosing Thoughts: Progress is a Team Sport # It’s not just about the code. It’s about the conversations, the debates, and the shared vision. Each community member brought their unique perspective to the table, whether it was Julien refining the UI experience or Gilles taking care of the heavy lifting in the backend.\nAs Plakar continues to evolve, expect more innovation, more polish, and (hopefully) fewer sleepless nights for our developers. Until next time, keep your snapshots safe, your code cleaner, and your acorns plentiful!\n— Plakup, your chirpy Plakar companion 🐿️\n","date":"12 October 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/community-news/2024-10_01/","section":"Plakar community updates","summary":"","title":"Plakup's Chronicles: A Journey Through Recent Plakar Developments","type":"community-news"},{"content":"Back in August 2019, a project called Plakar began to take shape. Initially an experiment, it was developed by Gilles Chehade as a personal response to dissatisfaction with existing backup solutions. While many backup tools promise reliability and ease, they often come with limitations that become apparent at scale. Plakar aimed to address these issues head-on, focusing on simplicity, speed, and flexibility. Let\u0026rsquo;s dive into what makes Plakar unique and its evolution over time.\nWhy Plakar? # Plakar was conceived out of a desire for a more lightweight, flexible, and scalable backup solution. Existing backup systems either felt overly complex or couldn’t handle large datasets efficiently without consuming tons of resources. Most required expensive servers to run or were riddled with features that were unnecessary for everyday backups.\nPlakar’s core goal from the outset was simple: build a fast and efficient backup tool that anyone can run, even on modest hardware. It was born out of frustration but quickly grew into a fully-fledged project that promised a better way to think about backups.\nThe Design Philosophy # At its core, Plakar took inspiration from Git’s repository model. Just like Git tracks changes in code repositories over time, Plakar tracks snapshots of a filesystem. However, it avoids some of the bloat and complexity associated with Git for backup use cases.\nFilesystem Snapshot Model: Plakar takes snapshots of the file system, storing only the differences between snapshots (much like a version control system). This allows for fast incremental backups without having to re-copy unchanged data. Data Deduplication: One of the standout features in Plakar’s design is deduplication, which means that identical data across multiple snapshots is only stored once. This is crucial for large datasets, where redundancy can quickly bloat storage. Designed for Modesty: Unlike heavyweight solutions that demand significant resources, Plakar was built to run on modest hardware. Whether you’re backing up to a small NAS or a low-powered server, Plakar’s design ensures that the system is both efficient and lean. Evolution Over Time # What began as an experiment quickly matured into a more feature-complete solution. Gilles emphasized that Plakar is not a one-size-fits-all solution—it doesn’t try to be a full-featured, all-encompassing backup system. Instead, Plakar focuses on doing one thing well: efficiently managing backups on a local or remote system.\nAt the heart of Plakar’s success is its incremental development process, where each new feature added is carefully considered for its real-world utility. From deduplication and delta snapshotting to its Git-like model for managing files, Plakar’s progression is marked by a constant desire to simplify and improve the backup process.\nThe Road Ahead # While Plakar has come a long way since its early days, there’s always more work to be done. Future plans for Plakar include improved repository handling and support for additional storage backends, making it even more flexible.\nThe core philosophy, however, remains the same: keep it simple, keep it fast, and keep it lightweight. Whether you’re running backups on a massive data center or a small home server, Plakar’s minimalist design ensures that it can scale and adapt to your needs without unnecessary complexity.\nIn short, Plakar has grown from an experimental tool into a reliable and efficient backup solution for those who value simplicity, performance, and flexibility. Whether you’re protecting your personal data or managing large-scale backups, Plakar is designed to make that process as smooth and resource-friendly as possible.\nStay tuned for more updates as Plakar continues to evolve!\n","date":"20 July 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/community-news/2024-07_02/","section":"Plakar community updates","summary":"","title":"Plakup's Chronicles: A Glimpse into its Early Days and Design Philosophy","type":"community-news"},{"content":"Hello, world! 🌍\nI’m Plakup, your friendly neighborhood chipmunk correspondent from Plakar Korp, and I’m here to keep you in the loop on all things Plakar—the fast, efficient backup solution you never knew you needed.\nWhat’s Plakar, you ask?
