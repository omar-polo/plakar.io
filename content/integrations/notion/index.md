## Backup your Notion data with Plakar

Plakar’s Notion integration offers a reliable way to protect your content against deletion, corruption, or unauthorized changes. Pages, databases, media files and comments are backed up automatically and stored in secure, immutable snapshots.

Unlike native Notion exports, Plakar captures complete structured representations of your content using its internal snapshot model, enabling traceability, inspection, and future restoration.

## Why back up Notion?

Notion provides platform availability but does not guarantee recovery. If content is deleted, edited by mistake, or compromised via API or integrations, it is lost permanently without a user-managed backup.

With Plakar:

- Data is captured using the official Notion API
- Snapshots are cryptographically verified and immutable
- Each backup is self-contained and browsable
- Your storage backend is fully configurable (local, cloud, object storage)

## Supported features

- Full page content, structure and blocks
- Databases and properties
- File attachments (images, documents, embeds)
- Comments
- Hierarchical relationships between pages
- Incremental snapshot deduplication
- Storage to any backend (filesystem, S3, SFTP)

## Limitations

- Restore functionality is not available yet (planned in a future release)
- Integration must be manually shared with each page to access its content
- Some third-party Notion blocks may not serialize perfectly

For setup instructions, see the [configuration guide](/docs/main/integrations/notion).

## Threats mitigated

- Accidental deletions
- API inconsistencies and data loss
- Unauthorized or malicious edits
- Workspace corruption
- Limitations of built-in exports
