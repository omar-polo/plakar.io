# Stdio Integration

## Overview

The **Stdio integration** enables seamless backup and restoration of stdio streams to and from a [Kloset repository](/posts/2025-04-29/kloset-the-immutable-data-store/).

This integration is designed to protect the data on your local hard drives, mounted NAS volumes, and SANs.

## Configuration

The **Stdio integration** does not require any special configuration.

## Example Usage

To back up, you can use the following commands which will copy the content of the stdio stream to a file named `passwd` within the snapshot:

```sh
$ cat /etc/passwd | plakar at /var/backups backup stdin:passwd
```

Restore can be done to a file:

```sh
$ plakar at /var/backups restore fc1b1e94:passwd
```

or can also use an stdout stream:

```sh
$ plakar at /var/backups restore -to stdout:- fc1b1e94:passwd
```




See the [QuickStart guide](https://docs.plakar.io/en/quickstart/index.html) for more examples.

**Can you ingest command outputs ?**

Yes, the **Stdio integration** was designed to ingest data from `pg_dump`, `mysql_dump` and similar commands.
